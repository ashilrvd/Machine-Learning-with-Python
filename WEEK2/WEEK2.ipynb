    "        In regression, the independent variable(s) is used to predict the dependent variable, so the requirements for them are different. The independent variable can be either categorical or continuous, it can be any variable that can explain the variation in the dependent variable. On the other hand, the dependent variable is the variable that we are trying to predict, it must be continuous. It can be a real-valued number, such as a price, weight, height, etc. It could also be a time series, such as stock prices, temperature, etc."

    "        Simple linear regression involves estimating a single dependent variable using a single independent variable. Multiple linear regression, as the name suggests, involves estimating a single dependent variable using multiple independent variables. The key difference between simple and multiple regression is the number of independent variables. In multiple linear regression, we use more than one independent variable to predict the value of the dependent variable. The relationship between the independent and dependent variables is assumed to be linear, which means the change in the dependent variable is proportional to the change in the independent variable"

    "        The relationship between CO2 emission and car information can be represented by the equation CO2_emission = 130 - 2.4cylinders + 8.3fuel_consumption. This equation is a linear equation. The coefficients of independent variables(cylinders and fuel_consumption) indicate the relationship between the variables and the dependent variable. The coefficient of cylinders is -2.4, which means that as the number of cylinders increases, the CO2 emission decreases by 2.4 units. The coefficient of fuel_consumption is 8.3, which means that as the fuel consumption increases, the CO2 emission increases by 8.3 units. Since the coefficient of fuel_consumption is greater than that of cylinders, the fuel consumption has a higher impact on CO2 emission.\n"

The noise or randomness in the training data is unlikely to be present in the new data, so the model will perform poorly on it.
