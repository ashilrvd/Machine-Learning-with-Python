    "        A major benefit of unsupervised learning over supervised learning is that it allows the model to discover previously unknown information about the dataset. Unsupervised learning models can identify patterns, group similar observations together and extract useful features from the data, even if the data is unlabelled. In contrast, supervised learning models rely on labeled data and predefined features to make predictions, so they may not be able to identify new patterns and relationships in the data."

The second example, segmenting customers into groups for discovering similar characteristics between them, is an unsupervised learning problem. The third example, examine the relationship between academic performance and level of in-class participation, is a supervised learning problem because it involves labeled data (observations that include student’s grade). The fourth example, predict house price based on location, house size, and number of rooms, is a supervised learning problem because it involves labeled data (house price)."

It provides a powerful and flexible array object, as well as a large set of mathematical functions to operate on those arrays. NumPy is widely used in scientific and mathematical computing, data analysis, and machine learning, because it allows for fast and efficient numerical computations on large arrays of data. While it does not include visualization or model construction tools, it can be integrated with other libraries to achieve those tasks."
